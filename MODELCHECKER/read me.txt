In this sample file, on the first line, the first entry AyX[xy], is the formula
The next entry,2 is the number of nodes
Then next entry, 2 is the number of edges
The next four entries specify the edges (0,0), (0,1).
From last 3 entries, the variable assignment maps x to 0, y to 0 and z to 0. 

On the second line we specify the second formula and graph.
The formula is Ex-X[xx]. It has 2 nodes, 2 edges, the edges are (1,1), (0,0) and the variable assignment maps x, y, z to 0, 0, 1.

The remaining four lines specify 4 different formulas, graphs, variable assignments.
